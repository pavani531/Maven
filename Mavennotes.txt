*It allows developers to build and documents the life cycle framework

ANT:it is also called as Apache ANT,It can be used as an alternate for Maven
*Ant is open source build tool for software development.It uses XML files to describe,structure and control the build process

maven repository:In maven terminology,a repository is a directory where all the project jars,library jar,plugins or any other project specific artifacts are stored and can be used by Maven easily

MAVEN COMMANDS:
1)mvn clean: It cleans the maven project by deleting the target directory
2)mv compiler:compile:- It compiles the java source classes of the maven project
3)mvn compiler:testCompiler:- it compiles the test classes of the maven project
4)mvn package:it builds packages
5)mvn install:it installs the project files to the local repository
6)mvn deploy:it is used to deploy the artifacts to the remote repository
7)mvn validate:it validates the project that everything is correct and all the necessary information is avalable
8)mvn dependency:tree:-it generates the dependency tree of the maven project
9)mvn dependency:analyze:- it is usefull for reducing the build size by identifying the unused dependencies and then removes it from the file
10)mvn test: used to run the test cases
11)mvn compile:used to compile the source java classes

MAVEN POM:
*POM stands for Project Object Model,It is fundamental unit of work in Maven. It is an XML file that resides in the base directory of the project as pom.xml.
*While executing the program maven looks for the POM in the current directory.It reads the POM,gets the needed configuration information and executes the task
Some of the configuration information that can be specified in the POM are:
1)Project dependencies
2)plugins
3)goals
4)build profiles
5)project version
6)developers
7)mailing list

ARTIFACT ID:
*artifactId is the name of the jar without version
*In a company, some other project or group of people may also have same artifact id (Let's say math-util)â€¦ To let us differentiate our group work from others, we need one identifycation.That identification will be provided by the artifact id.

GROUP ID
*The groupId is an XML element in the POM.XML file of a Maven project that specifies the id of the project group.
* in Maven is the groupId helps to identify the project group while artifactId helps to identify the project.
